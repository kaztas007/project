In general round-robin algorithm with different time quantum is used for such maintenance. The Number of ready queue algorithm between the queue, algorithm inside a queue algorithm but the queues may change from system to system. There is a various class of scheduling algorithm which is created for situations like in which the processes are easily divided into the different groups. A common division is made between foreground (interactive) processes and background (batch) processes. These two types of processes have different response-time requirements and so may have different scheduling needs. In addition, foreground processes may have priority (externally deÔ¨Åned) over background processes. A multilevel queue scheduling algorithm partitions the ready queue into several separate queues. The processes are permanently assigned to one queue, generally based on some property of the process, such as memory size, process priority, or process type. Each queue has its own scheduling algorithm. For example, separate queues might be used for foreground and background processes. The foreground queue might be scheduled by an FCFS algorithm, while the background queue is scheduled by an RR algorithm.
